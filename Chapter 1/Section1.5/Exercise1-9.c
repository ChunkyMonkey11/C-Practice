/*
Reads characters one-by-one.

Tracks whether the last character you read was a space.

If you see a space, you only print the first one.

If more spaces come after it, you just ignore them.

When you hit a non-space character again, you start printing everything normally again â€” and if a space comes after that, it's a new "first space", so you print that one.
